in a client-server application, a single-server host is incapable of keeping up with all the requests from clients. For example, a popular social-networking site can
quickly become overwhelmed if it has only one server handling all of its requests
在大型服務中，單一server不夠力
a data center, housing a large number of hosts, is often used to create a powerful virtual server
data center創造一個虛擬server來補足單一server不夠力的問題
Google has 30 to 50 data centers distributed around the world
P2P architecture there is minimal (or no) reliance on dedicated servers in data centers ，the application exploits direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers
p2p架構幾乎不需要server，而是兩點以間歇性的頻率連接，此種點稱為peers
也有兩種架構混合使用的服務
One of the most compelling features of P2P architectures is their self-scalability
p2p最吸引人的部分在於可自行擴展(查)
p2p面臨的挑戰
(1)isp friendly
由於底層實體網?是由?同 Internet Service 
Provider (ISP)業者提供各網域的網?服務，?同 ISP
之間的網?頻寬有限且費用昂貴，而目前 P2P 網?
組成?考慮實體網?位置之特性，將造成大?且快
速產生 Inter-ISP Traffic，已成為各 ISP 業者極為頭
痛之問題[1][3]，故?少 ISP 業者皆開始阻擋 P2P
網?服務之??，以確保其他網?服務之傳輸品

(2)security
分散和公開，使安全性降低
(3)Incentives
p2p成功有激勵作用

Processes on two different end systems communicate with each other by exchanging
messages across the computer network
we typically label one of the two
processes as the client and the other process as the server
With the Web, a browser is a client process and a Web server is a server process. With P2P file
sharing, the peer that is downloading the file is labeled as the client, and the peer that is uploading the file is labeled as the server.
p2p中，同一個點可能身兼client和server，但還是可以定義
the
process that initiates the communication (that is, initially contacts the other
process at the beginning of the session) is labeled as the client. The process
that waits to be contacted to begin the session is the server.
一開始聯絡他人的是client 被動的是server
A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software
interface called a socket
client和server process溝通的平台稱為socket
process像房子 socket像門
要知道接收的process的訊息要具備(1) the address of the host and (2) an identifier that specifies the receiving process
in the destination host.
in general
a host could be running many network applications. A destination port number
serves this purpose
socket is the interface between the application process and the
transport-layer protocol.
transport-layer 可能支援不只一種protocol，看需求做選擇
We can broadly classify the possible services along four dimensions:
reliable data transfer, throughput, timing, and security.
以四種維度分類服務
(1)Reliable Data Transfer
封包可能掉，造成損失，所以需要有確認機制
If a protocol provides such a guaranteed data delivery service, it is said to provide
reliable data transfer
相對地稱為loss-tolerant applications
(2)Throughput
the sending process can deliver bits to the receiving process
吞吐量會波動
transport-layer protocol could provide, namely, guaranteed available throughput
at some specified rate
可以保證基本的效率
有吞體量要求的稱為bandwidth-sensitive applications
(3)Timing
A transport-layer protocol can also provide timing guarantees
保證時間，如網路電話或game
(4)Security
a transport protocol can provide an application with one or more security
services
傳的一方加密，收的一方解密或提供其他認證方法
TCP:有Reliable Data Transfer的service
Connection-oriented service.
TCP的CLIENT和server在資訊傳輸前會交換transportlayer control information，稱為handshaking procedure，可以避免猛烈的封包攻擊，
tcp有阻塞控制機制
limit each TCP connection
to its fair share of network bandwidth.
UDP:輕便的，沒有handshaking，沒有Reliable Data Transfer機制，沒有阻塞防治機制

An application-layer protocol defines how an application’s processes, running on different
end systems, pass messages to each other.
application-layer protocol 定義了
(1)The types of messages exchanged, for example, request messages and response
messages
(2) The syntax of the various message types, such as the fields in the message and
how the fields are delineated
(3)The semantics of the fields, that is, the meaning of the information in the fields
(4)Rules for determining when and how a process sends messages and responds to
messages
HTTP為一種application-layer protocol 
principal application-layer protocol for electronic mail is SMTP
